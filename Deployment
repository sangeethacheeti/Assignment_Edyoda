Steps:

1.Open the Deployment YAML File:
    ->Edit the deployment.yaml file 

2.Increase Replicas and Update Image:
    ->Increase the number of replicas (e.g., set replicas: 2) to ensure there are multiple instances running.
    ->Update the image field to the new image version (e.g., my-new-image:latest).

3.Apply the Updated Configuration:
    ->Run kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml to apply the changes.
    ->Kubernetes will create a new ReplicaSet with the updated image.

4.Monitor Rollout Status:
    ->Check the rollout status using kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment.
    ->Wait until the new pods are fully available.

5.Verify New Version:
    ->Confirm that the new image is running by using kubectl get pods -l app=my-deployment.

6.Rollback (if needed):
     ->If anything goes wrong, roll back to the previous version using kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment.
